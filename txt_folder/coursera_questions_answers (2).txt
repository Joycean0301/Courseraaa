DueJun 25, 11:59 PM +07|||Is it possible to run completely different operating systems on Virtual Machines (VMs) that are on a single host? If yes, what makes this possible?|||No, it is not possible—VMs are software-based versions of a single host. They cannot have different environments from one another. 
No, it is not possible—A single host can only work as one single virtual environment, and can, therefore, have only one environment. 
Yes, Virtualization makes it possible— to have VMs, running different operating systems, on a single host. 
Yes, Containerization makes it possible—to have VMs that are unique physical entities, so you can have completely different Operating Systems on them. |||Yes, Virtualization makes it possible— to have VMs, running different operating systems, on a single host. @@@Module 3 Graded Quiz

DueJun 25, 11:59 PM +07|||What are some key differences between Containers and Virtual Machines? Select two.|||Even though each container uses the same OS as the host OS, it still needs to have its own copy of the OS, while a virtual machine leverages the resources of the host OS 
Containers are executable units of software while each virtual machine is a distinct physical entity 
Containers are more lightweight as compared to virtual machines 
Containers can use the same OS as the host, while a virtual machine needs its own copy of the OS, which can also be different from the host OS |||Containers are more lightweight as compared to virtual machines
