        "Question": "It\u2019s your 2nd week as an IT support specialist at a health system in New York City. You\u2019re contacted by an office manager for an outpatient clinic because the primary care physicians in her practice are not able to print out prescriptions for their patients. After asking for her full name, userID and a good call back number, you proceed with troubleshooting the issue. She says that the HP Photosmart C420 printer was working fine yesterday. She confirms that the printer is plugged in. She also explains that there\u2019s paper in the printer and no error message. You ask her to go to her settings and to pull up the Printer application. This is what she sees. Which of the following would be an appropriate response?",
        "Answer": [
            "\u201cThis is odd. It looks like the correct printer has been selected, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the issue. Let\u2019s see it\u2019s a driver compatibility issue.\u201d",
            "\u201cThis is pretty surprising that your clinic isn\u2019t making use of e-prescribing. I don\u2019t understand why you would still be printing out prescriptions and handing them to patients.\u201d",
            "\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything we can do at this time. Since it\u2019s likely a matter of ordering a new printer for the clinic. We have several options in the technology store. Would you like me to share the website with you?\u201d",
            "\u201cAh, I see what\u2019s going on. It looks like you are low on toner. Whenever that happens, it\u2019s important to replace the print cartridge. I\u2019m happy to go through the steps involved with that if you\u2019d like.\u201d",
            "\u201cDo not worry, we should be able to resolve this quickly for you. It appears that the printer you\u2019d like to be printing to is offline. So the prescriptions have been printing to a printer elsewhere. I\u2019ll walk you through selecting the correct printer, but also recommend that you go to the other printer to find the prescriptions so that protected health information isn\u2019t shared with individuals who don\u2019t need to have access to it.\u201d",
            "\u201cSounds like a paper jam. What you need to do is resolve that, and then you should see the prescriptions printing out properly. I\u2019m happy to walk you through the steps involved in fixing this matter. It can generally result from a misfeed and if the paper appears crumpled, we\u2019ll need to carefully remove all of it. Then we\u2019ll be able to test things again to see if the prescriptions are printing properly.\u201d"
