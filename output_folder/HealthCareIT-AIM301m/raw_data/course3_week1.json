    "Question": "A 68-year-old female with a history of obesity, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol is brought in by ambulance to the emergency room because of lightheadedness and chest pain. In the ER, an electrocardiogram indicates that she has an irregular heartbeat. This appears to be consistent with atrial fibrillation. However, the ER is in a rural area and is staffed only by mid-level providers over the Christmas holidays. There are no Cardiologists who can be consulted, but thanks to a state-wide initiative to promote telemedicine, there is a pilot underway. One of the ER staff members logs into the portal that has been provided by a telemedicine vendor the state has contracted with. She is able to speak with a licensed and credentialed Cardiologist who requests that she place a digital stethoscope on the patient's heart.   \n\nWhich of the following terms can be used to describe the digital stethoscope?  ",
