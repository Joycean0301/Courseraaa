    "Question": "Take a look at the following image and then read the scenario below.  \n\nAs a help desk agent at a large hospital, you receive a call from a nurse who is frantic. She needs to give a patient a blood transfusion. The patient has arrived with a wristband and the nurse is very concerned about the wristband. “There are 4 barcodes on the wristband!!! I think a mistake has been made! What do I do? Do I need to get the patient a new wristband? I have to scan the wristband for proper identification before proceeding with the blood transfusion. Help!”   \n\n Which of the following would be a correct response to the nurse?",
    "Answer": [
      "“You’re correct to be concerned. I’ve never seen this type of issue before. Very strange. Let me escalate the matter to the Tier 2 support staff so they can help you.”",

      "“I think you should take the wristband off the patient immediately. Let me see what I can do to get the patient a new wristband that only has 1 barcode on it.”",
      "“What are you talking about? Did you not receive training on proper barcode scanning and use of patient wristbands? How long have you been in this role?”"

    "Question": "It’s your 2nd week as an IT support specialist at a health system in New York City. You’re contacted by an office manager for an outpatient clinic because the primary care physicians in her practice are not able to print out prescriptions for their patients. After asking for her full name, userID and a good call back number, you proceed with troubleshooting the issue. She says that the HP Photosmart C420 printer was working fine yesterday. She confirms that the printer is plugged in. She also explains that there’s paper in the printer and no error message. You ask her to go to her settings and to pull up the Printer application. This is what she sees. Which of the following would be an appropriate response?",

So the prescriptions have been printing to a printer elsewhere. I’ll walk you through selecting the correct printer, but also recommend that you go to the other printer to find the prescriptions so that protected health information isn’t shared with individuals who don’t need to have access to it.”",

I’m happy to walk you through the steps involved in fixing this matter. It can generally result from a misfeed and if the paper appears crumpled, we’ll need to carefully remove all of it.
