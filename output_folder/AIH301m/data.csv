 A small health care start-up company has developed a machine learning model to predict the onset of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension and heart failure, in order to identify patients who might benefit from receiving preventive interventions such as lipid-lowering medications.

In order to avoid fines from the Medicare Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), a health system is developing an AI-based model to predict which of their patients who are hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of pneumonia will be readmitted within 30 days after the patient was admitted.  A large national study of Medicare beneficiaries found that the HRRP did lower risk-adjusted readmissions rates of pneumonia patients.  It also found that the 30-day and 1-year risk-adjusted mortality rates increased.
