DueJul 30, 11:59 PM +07|||The D-DIMER values are highly concentrated <1k, but there are many samples that are several orders of magnitude apart from the rest of the samples. What is the most likely explanation for this? (Hint: look at the data samples, particularly the exam metadata.)|||The data collected from one the clinics may use different units^^^There is a large disparity in D-DIMER lab values across patient gender^^^The data was collected from two cohorts from two different time periods^^^There is a large disparity in D-DIMER lab values across patient age|||The data collected from one the clinics may use different units@@@Phase 2.
