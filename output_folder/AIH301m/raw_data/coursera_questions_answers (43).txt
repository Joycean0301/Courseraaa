Check all that apply.  |||A model that predicts the number of days before a patient requires invasive mechanical ventilation. This model would be trained only on patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation.^^^A model that predicts what range of days it will take for a patient to require invasive mechanical ventilation. The 4 categories include: [“0-4 days”, “5-9 days”, “10-14 days”, “14+ days or will not need one”]^^^A regression model that predicts the patient’s date of death.^^^A binary classification model that predicts whether or not the patient will require hospitalization.|||A model that predicts the number of days before a patient requires invasive mechanical ventilation.

What are some possible errors that might have gotten introduced to the data before it was published? Check all that apply.  |||Labs are logged AFTER the invasive mechanical ventilation^^^The patient was a recent transfer from another system^^^The patient comes to ED and gets immediately intubated, thus no labs are provided^^^The patient had been to the hospital multiple times|||Labs are logged AFTER the invasive mechanical ventilation^^^The patient was a recent transfer from another system^^^The patient comes to ED and gets immediately intubated, thus no labs are provided
