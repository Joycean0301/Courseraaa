Principal Components Analysis (PCA)  is a common dimensionality reduction method that uses feature extraction (synthetic dimensions) as opposed to feature selection (where selected dimensions are the most significant natural features of the data such as engine displacement and horsepower which we saw in the previous example). It is easier to think in terms of natural features but from a statistical perspective their main weaknesses are:,"There are often many features so it is hard for one feature to be highly significant
The features often have a high degree of collinearity and so are highly correlated.
Feature selection is subjective as opposed to PCA which is objective.","There are often many features so it is hard for one feature to be highly significant

"If you were going to enter a pairs trade with KLAC and ADSK, the decision about which stock to go long and which to short would depend on on your analysis of each company's exposure to Component 2. We talked before about how Component 1 was closely related to Beta and KLAC and ADSK have fairly similar Betas. Component 2 could be similar to the 'Value' factor which explains returns based on the Price/Earnings ratios of stocks. In the XLK ETF, stocks with higher Component 2 loadings tend to be growth stocks and those with negative loadings tend to be value stocks. ADSK has a P/E ratio of about 275 versus KLAC's P/E of 25.

To justify going long KLAC and short ADSK you would need to expect that:","The market will place a higher value on earnings growth potential than current earnings
P/E ratios will remain stable for KLAC and ADSK and earnings will increase by the same percentage for both companies

"Bridgewater and other hedge funds use a risk parity approach to investing. At its simplest this strategy takes diversified portfolios of assets (or strategies) and increases their potential return by borrowing money to finance them (leverage). In this way a relatively low risk, low return strategy can be financed by a high level of debt so that its potential return on trading capital (not total investment) is much higher. This higher potential return comes with higher potential downside risk though, but this is the standard business model of hedge funds, almost all carry high leverage.

For example lets say you manage a hedge fund that has a diversified portfolio of strategies that when combined yield a relatively low risk income stream of 2% with a volatility of just 1%. How would this compare to an investment in an S&P 500 index fund that has an expected return of 12% and a volatility of 20%? Assume your hedge fund  borrows enough to increase the leveraged risk of its strategy portfolio to the same level as the unleveraged risk of the index fund. What would the leveraged return on the strategy portfolio be? Assume your hedge fund has $1 million of trading capital and $1 million is also invested in the index fund.","12%
