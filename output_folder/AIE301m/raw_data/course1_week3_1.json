      "The data had too steep a slope",
      "The data had an exponential component (increasing slope).",
      "The data were spread out over a long period of time."

    "Question": "What is the difference between seasonality and cyclicality?",
    "Answer": [
      "Seasonality refers to cycles that repeat on an annual basis. Cyclicality refers to cycles that can be longer than a year.",
      "Seasonality refers to data that varies according to 3-month cycles, the same length as seasons of the year.",
      "There is no difference. Seasonality and cyclicality are the same thing."
    ],
    "Correct": [
      "Seasonality refers to cycles that repeat on an annual basis. Cyclicality refers to cycles that can be longer than a year."

      "MA uses lagged values of the error terms and AR uses lagged values of the data itself."
    ],
    "Correct": [
