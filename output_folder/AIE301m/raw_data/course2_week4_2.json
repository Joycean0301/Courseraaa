    "Question": "You have backtested 10 trading strategies using two distinct data sets representing different market regimes (down-trending with high volatility and up-trending with low volatility).

Your analysis predicts a 75% chance that the market will be up-trending and low volatility and 25% chance that it will be down-trending and high volatility.  Which strategy or combination of strategies would you choose for implementation or further backtesting and why would you choose it or them?",
    "Answer": [
      "Implement Strategy 6 because it has the highest Sharpe ratio and it is the most likely market regime.",
      "Implement a  combination of Strategy 7 and 10 as this will give you the highest expected return regardless of the market regime.",
      "Implement a  combination of Strategy 3 and 6 as this will give you the highest expected Sharpe ratio regardless of the market regime.",
