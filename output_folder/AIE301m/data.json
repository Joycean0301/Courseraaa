        "Question": "Bridgewater and other hedge funds use a risk parity approach to investing. At its simplest this strategy takes diversified portfolios of assets (or strategies) and increases their potential return by borrowing money to finance them (leverage). In this way a relatively low risk, low return strategy can be financed by a high level of debt so that its potential return on trading capital (not total investment) is much higher. This higher potential return comes with higher potential downside risk though, but this is the standard business model of hedge funds, almost all carry high leverage.\n\nFor example lets say you manage a hedge fund that has a diversified portfolio of strategies that when combined yield a relatively low risk income stream of 2% with a volatility of just 1%. How would this compare to an investment in an S&P 500 index fund that has an expected return of 12% and a volatility of 20%? Assume your hedge fund  borrows enough to increase the leveraged risk of its strategy portfolio to the same level as the unleveraged risk of the index fund. What would the leveraged return on the strategy portfolio be? Assume your hedge fund has $1 million of trading capital and $1 million is also invested in the index fund.",
