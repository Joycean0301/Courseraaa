    "Question": "If we have a situation where false positive is not as potentially costly as a false negative say flagging comments for manual review based on suspected unlawful activity, which of the following is the best approach to consider?",
    "Answer": [
      "Only look at the f-score of the negative class for evaluation",
      "Use recall as the evaluation metric",
      "Use precision as the evaluation metric",
      "Set beta to 0.5 in the fscore",
      "Set beta to 2.0 in the fscore"
    ],
    "Correct": [
      "Set beta to 2.0 in the fscore"
