    "Question": "In which situation would you most strongly consider MAE over RMSE as a regression metric?",
    "Answer": [
      "where we would like to interpret the error metric in terms of the original units\r",
      "like predicting daily temperature where we expect a small range of values",
      "like predicting time to failure for a machine where we expect a long tailed distribution of values",
      "like predicting the category or topic associated with a document",
      "where we would like to interpret the error metric as a squared version of the original units"
    ],
