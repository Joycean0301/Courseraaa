    "Question": "There are many established methods from the literature that may be used to analyze time-series data. Classical machine learning techniques can also be used, but which of the following is the most important caveat to keep in mind when employing this approach?",
    "Answer": [
      "You cannot use scikit-learn to combine multiple predictions",
      "The data cannot be feature engineered to help identify features that are needed by the model to detect trends",
      "There is no simple way to do a train/test split of the data",
      "Significant computational resources are generally required",
      "A specialized strategy that uses recursion (for example) or multiple models must be employed for multipoint forecasting"
    ],
    "Correct": [
