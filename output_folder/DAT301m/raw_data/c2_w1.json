    "Question": "When exploring the graphs, the loss levelled out at about .75 after 2 epochs, but the accuracy climbed close to 1.0 after 15 epochs. What's the significance of this?",
    "Answer": [
      "There was no point training after 2 epochs, as we overfit to the validation data",
      "There was no point training after 2 epochs, as we overfit to the training data",
      "A bigger training set would give us better validation accuracy",
      "A bigger validation set would give us better training accuracy"

    "Question": "Why is the validation accuracy a better indicator of model performance than training accuracy?",
    "Answer": [
      "It isn't, they're equally valuable",
      "There's no relationship between them",
      "The validation accuracy is based on images that the model hasn't been trained with, and thus a better indicator of how the model will perform with new images.",
      "The validation dataset is smaller, and thus less accurate at measuring accuracy, so its performance isn't as important"

    "Question": "Why is overfitting more likely to occur on smaller datasets?",
    "Answer": [
      "Because in a smaller dataset, your validation data is more likely to look like your training data",
      "Because there isn't enough data to activate all the convolutions or neurons",
      "Because with less data, the training will take place more quickly, and some features may be missed",
      "Because there's less likelihood of all possible features being encountered in the training process."
    ],
    "Correct": [
      "Because there's less likelihood of all possible features being encountered in the training process."
