    "Answer": [
      "Ignore all the classes above yours (i.e. Numbers 2 onwards if I'm just classing 2)",
      "Use all classes but set their weights to 0",
      "When you add your DNN at the bottom of the network, you specify your output layer with the number of classes you want",

    "Answer": [
      "Because neighbor neurons can have similar weights, and thus can skew the final training ",

    "Question": "What would the symptom of a Dropout rate being set too high?",
    "Answer": [
      "The network would lose specialization to the effect that it would be inefficient or ineffective at learning, driving accuracy down",
      "Training time would increase due to the extra calculations being required for higher dropout"
