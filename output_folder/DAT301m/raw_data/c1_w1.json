    "Question": "What is the difference between traditional programming and Machine Learning?",
    "Answer": [
      "Machine learning identifies complex activities such as golf, while traditional programming is better suited to simpler activities such as walking.",
      "In traditional programming, a programmer has to formulate or code rules manually, whereas, in Machine Learning, the algorithm automatically formulates the rules from the data."
    ],
    "Correct": [
