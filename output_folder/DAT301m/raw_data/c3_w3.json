    "Question": "Why does sequence make a large difference when determining semantics of language?",
    "Answer": [
      "Because the order in which words appear dictate their impact on the meaning of the sentence",
      "Because the order of words doesn’t matter",
      "It doesn’t",
      "Because the order in which words appear dictate their meaning"

    "Answer": [
      "They don’t",

      "Values from earlier words can be carried to later ones via a cell state",
      "They shuffle the words randomly"
