    "Question": "What is the difference between traditional programming and Machine Learning?",
    "Answer": [
      "In traditional programming, a programmer has to formulate or code rules manually, whereas, in Machine Learning, the algorithm automatically formulates the rules from the data.",
      "Machine learning identifies complex activities such as golf, while traditional programming is better suited to simpler activities such as walking."
    ],
    "Correct": [
