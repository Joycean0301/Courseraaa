    "Question": "If my training data only has people facing left, but I want to classify people facing right, how would I avoid overfitting?",
    "Answer": [
      "Use the ‘flip’ parameter",
      "Use the ‘flip_vertical’ parameter around the Y axis",
      "Use the ‘horizontal_flip’ parameter",
      "Use the ‘flip’ parameter and set ‘horizontal’"

    "Correct": [
      "Use the ‘horizontal_flip’ parameter"

    "Question": "After adding data augmentation and using the same batch size and steps per epoch, you noticed that each training epoch became a little slower than when you trained without it. Why?",
    "Answer": [
      "Because there is more data to train on",
      "Because the training is making more mistakes",
      "Because the image preprocessing takes cycles",
      "Because the augmented data is bigger"
    ],
    "Correct": [
      "Because the image preprocessing takes cycles"

    "Question": "What does the fill_mode parameter do?",
    "Answer": [
      "There is no fill_mode parameter",
      "It creates random noise in the image",
      "It attempts to recreate lost information after a transformation like a shear",
      "It masks the background of an image"
    ],

    "Question": "When using Image Augmentation with the ImageDataGenerator, what happens to your raw image data on-disk.",
    "Answer": [
      "It gets overwritten, so be sure to make a backup",
      "A copy is made and the augmentation is done on the copy",
      "Nothing, all augmentation is done in-memory",
      "It gets deleted"

    "Question": "How does Image Augmentation help solve overfitting?",
    "Answer": [
      "It slows down the training process",
      "It manipulates the training set to generate more scenarios for features in the images",
      "It manipulates the validation set to generate more scenarios for features in the images",
      "It automatically fits features to images by finding them through image processing techniques"
