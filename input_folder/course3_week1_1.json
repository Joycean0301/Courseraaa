    "Question": "Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents are given a high degree of freedom, often subject only to the constraints of the operator's risk tolerance and drawdown limits. What are the advantages this gives to a DRL strategy compared to other automated strategies?",
    "Answer": [
      "A high degree of freedom prevents the strategy from being influenced by the operator's emotions",
      "A high degree of freedom means the operator can set the strategy and 'forget it'. This means the operator can effectively oversee a larger portfolio of strategies.",
      "A high degree of freedom means the DRL agent can learn from its actions in various states and extend its knowledge beyond what was given by the developer."
    ],
    "Correct": [

    "Question": "We talked about how it has become increasingly difficult to make money trading pattern-recognition strategies. What advantage does reinforcement learning have in trading this type of strategy?",
    "Answer": [
      "An RL algorithm is faster at recognizing changes in the predictability and profitability of price patterns.",
      "An RL algorithm can more accurately identify the end of an uptrend in prices and also the beginning of a downtrend in prices.",
      "An RL algorithm can identify price patterns more quickly than other machine learning algos."

    "Correct": [
      "An RL algorithm is faster at recognizing changes in the predictability and profitability of price patterns."

    "Question": "Most quantitative strategies depend on a trader to develop and update the trading algorithm and a machine to implement it. What are some of the disadvantages of this human-machine symbiosis?",
    "Answer": [
      "It is hard for a trader to develop an algorithm that anticipates the characteristics of every possible market environment",
      "In today's algo-dominated markets it is necessary to use an order execution strategy to divide up a 'parent' order into several 'child' orders which need to be optimized based on market conditions.",
      "Exchange and other trading venue interfaces are not capable of executing complex, multi-part order as quickly as required by rapidly changing market environments."
