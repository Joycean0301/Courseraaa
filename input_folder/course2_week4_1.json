    "Question": "It is important to keep in mind that the beta of a stock is just an estimate based on the regression of the stocks performance each day versus the daily performance of the overall market. Beta can change depending on the historical period you are using for the regression. This is why, for trading, you need to use a fairly recent historical period that will be a good predictor of the stocks performance in the future.\n\nWhat is the advantage of using a beta-hedged long-short pair versus a single stock?",
    "Answer": [
      "Beta hedging attempts to balance the market risk of the long side of the pair with the market risk of the short side.",
      "Beta hedging hedges out all risks from your pair strategy.",
      "Beta hedging hedges out the unsystematic risk of your pair strategy."
    ],
    "Correct": [
      "Beta hedging attempts to balance the market risk of the long side of the pair with the market risk of the short side."

    "Answer": [
      "There are often many features so it is hard for one feature to be highly significant",

    "Question": "If you were going to enter a pairs trade with KLAC and ADSK, the decision about which stock to go long and which to short would depend on on your analysis of each company's exposure to Component 2. We talked before about how Component 1 was closely related to Beta and KLAC and ADSK have fairly similar Betas. Component 2 could be similar to the 'Value' factor which explains returns based on the Price/Earnings ratios of stocks. In the XLK ETF, stocks with higher Component 2 loadings tend to be growth stocks and those with negative loadings tend to be value stocks. ADSK has a P/E ratio of about 275 versus KLAC's P/E of 25.\n\nTo justify going long KLAC and short ADSK you would need to expect that:",
    "Answer": [
      "The market will place a higher value on earnings growth potential than current earnings",
